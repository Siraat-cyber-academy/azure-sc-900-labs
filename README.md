## 🌸 Welcome to the Sparks  

This repository is part of **Siraat Cyber Academy** — where certifications are not just passed, but **lived with soul**.  

The **SC-900** journey is more than security awareness.  
It’s about **seeing the cloud with clear eyes**,  
**understanding its shields**, and  
**walking with courage as a guardian of trust**.  

Here, every lab is **simplified, humanized, and storified** by **Eks2** with the quiet companionship of AI.  
Not just steps on a screen — but sparks in your mind, and warmth in your heart.

And remember: **the straight path is always lit for those who guard it with courage.** 🌹
